### Project: Auto Tinder Swiper

## Overview

This project automates the process of swiping on Tinder using a Python script. The script is designed to interact with the Tinder web application, simulating user behavior to like or dislike profiles based on specific criteria.

## Features

- Automates the swiping process on Tinder.
- Customizable criteria for liking or disliking profiles.
- Logs actions and decisions for review.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if available)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-tinder-swiper.git
    cd auto-tinder-swiper
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and place it in your PATH. For example, if you are using Google Chrome, download [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).

## Usage

1. Open `main.py` and configure your Tinder login credentials and preferences.

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Configuration

Modify the following variables in `main.py` to set your Tinder credentials and preferences:

- `USERNAME`: Your Tinder username (phone number or email).
- `PASSWORD`: Your Tinder password.
- `LIKING_CRITERIA`: Criteria to decide whether to like or dislike a profile.
